## About
This is my current personal portfolio site that aims to provide an insight into what I can offer a potential employer. It's a fairly static informative site that functions well across multiple resolutions and browsers. It's worth noting that the site is based on a HTML5UP template, aimed at reducing production time. This isn't my first portfolio site as I like to keep things fresh - expect a complete overhaul sometime during 2020.
